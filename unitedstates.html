            <p>Considering there are over 50 states to explore, I barely scratched the surface. Starting on the west
                coast, I headed for San Francisco and enjoyed the city (minus the steep hills), before popping over to
                Yosemite to visit my very first national park! We headed upwards along the coast towards Oregon,
                stopping at the Redwood national park. It was a perfect mix of city life and exploring nature. Already
                planning my next trip over...</p>

                    <h2>San Francisco</h2>
                    <p>When I first arrived in San Fran, there was a thick fog covering the city. This lifted throughout
                        the day, and allowed the city to flex it's charm, as well as the beautiful Golden Gate Bridge.
                        We spent most of time our time walking (slowly), the steep hills, to the windy street shown in
                        The Princess Diaries and Pier 39, a perfect place for humans and seals to rest and recover.

                    <h2>Yosemite National Park</h2>
                    <p>Yosemite was my first national park in the US, and it did not dissapoint. It's a few hours from
                        San Fran, made longer by the up and down, swirling roads. But, the hikes and views make it worth
                        it. We stayed in a cabin in the woods, which meant it was only a short drive to the hiking
                        points. We weren't brave enough to hike half dome, but ventured around this iconic walk.
                        However, we were brave enough to chuck ourselves out of a plane!</p>

                    <h2>Redwood National Park</h2>
                    <p>Redwood National Park, the home of some very very very big trees, perhaps the largest in the
                        world. One of our favourite walks was the "Grove o old Titans", which was the home to the oldest
                        and largest trees in the park. Keep an eye out for animals, as we saw a young deer nesting
                        amongst the leaves... bears are present throughout, althought we were unlucky and did not see
                        one (perhaps lucky!) </p>
